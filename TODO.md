# Items to do
- [ ] Finish unit testing the mach cone (the class appears to be working)

- [ ] Make a function that writes each mach cone to a csv file (simple circle and (x,y) location)

- [ ] Unit test each E0 operator -> either in a separate class or exposing the functions as public
 - The E0 operators could simply just take a mach cone class as an input

- [ ] Add macro for pure/debug

- [ ] Add Ralston's 2nd order method

- [ ] Figure out why the 2nd order reconstruction fails

- [ ] Add Dirichlet boundary conditions
   - [ ] Add time-dependent pressure boundary
- [ ] Add symmetry boundary conditions
- [ ] Add reflection boundary condition
- [ ] Make sure initial condidion python scripts are all 64bit floats
